          <p class="card-text">This project is a full-stack web application built with Python’s Flask framework and SQLAlchemy to provide a secure, user-friendly internal blogging platform—complete with registration, login/logout, profile management (including image uploads processed with Pillow), and full CRUD operations for posts. It uses PostgreSQL locally via pgAdmin and in production on Render, leverages Flask-WTForms for validation, and employs Bootstrap 5 for a responsive UI. With core functionality—user authentication, flash messaging, and database integration.</p>
          <p>Next, the project will be Dockerized and CI/CD pipelines will be established. Current efforts are focused on UI refinements, ensuring reliable disk-based image storage on Render, and adding API integration.</p>
